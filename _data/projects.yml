  desc: "In this project, the distance between monocular quadcopter and the object of interest is calculated. Using that and quad's ego position, the objects are tagged with GPS Lat/Long. After some interval the task of tagging is performed again and the objects are associated in different runs to find changes in environment. An implementation for detecting, tagging, and associating trees is carried out. Relevant resources will be published soon."

The core idea is to obtain <a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~dmcallester/SPS/" target="blank"><span class="navy">dense disparity map</a></span> with monocular MAV. Then the disparity map is passed to a deep network that performs multivariate regression, mimicking effect of variable number of outputs. <a href="https://github.com/diav79/deepfly" target="blank"><span class="navy">Here</a></span> is the step by step guide to train ResNet like network from scratch.
